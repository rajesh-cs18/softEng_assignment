### **ONE-SENTENCE**

>*"Code comprehension is a vital mental process in any maintenance activity, in particular, when working with else block of an if-else statement, so, a plugin SimplyHover is introduced to work with-in Eclipse IDE to make things sorted."*

### **INTRODUCTION**

Code comprehension is a vital mental process in any maintenance activity, in particular, when working with else block of an if-else statement of a lengthy block and complex conditions, the developer often feels sluggish even aggressive to figure out exact negation of if's condition to execute the else block, for that reason a plugin SimplyHover is introduced to work with-in Eclipse IDE to make things sorted.

### **RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**

It's matter of daily programming practice, we often get our hands in hairs while setting the else block routines. Reseachers observered the facilities provided by different [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)s, Code and Text editors such as **collapse blocks, hover the starting of block, Prettifier** and others.\
But the SimpyHover have capabilty to understand and execute the logical operators using values of used variables in test condtion. Then it will construct the negation of it and hover that.

### **RESULTS**

Proposed tool will help the concern developers to calmly work out, understand all possible situation when ***else*** block execute and find out the negation of every complex and lengthy ***if's condtion*** which cause ***else block*** to execute.
