### **ONE-SENTENCE**

>*"Brain's Concentration effect is investigated using [EEG device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20%28EEG%29%20is%20an%20electrophysiological%20monitoring%20method%20to,invasive%20electrodes%20are%20sometimes%20used%2C%20as%20in%20electrocorticography.) when software developers are doing **solo programming vs pair programming**."*

### **INTRODUCTION**

There are different programming-working patters of developers' choices. Such as solo programming, pair programming and team programming. Developers perfers working patterns as per his/her own nature either calm or stormy surrounding.\
Author studied how the working pattern effects the overall outcome of task using an electric device.

### **RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**

The concentration level is measured, either it is high or low under three different cases:

> + solo programming
> + pair programming (navigator)
> + pair programming (driver)

It is done by using [Electroencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20(EEG)%20is%20an%20electrophysiological,sometimes%20used%2C%20as%20in%20electrocorticography) technique, a monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp, although invasive electrodes are sometimes used, as in electrocorticography, with the help of [EEG device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography#:~:text=Electroencephalography%20%28EEG%29%20is%20an%20electrophysiological%20monitoring%20method%20to,invasive%20electrodes%20are%20sometimes%20used%2C%20as%20in%20electrocorticography.).
Research focuses on analyzing brain waves during production of software, if the waves can be affected by external factors such as pair programming or music.\
EEG device measures the brain-behavior relations of the developer and analyze the electromagnetic waves using ERD and correlation.

### **RESULTS**

The preliminary results of the analysis of pair programming confirms the higher concentration level as compared to solo programming.
